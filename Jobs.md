# How to get a tech job

Below are the four most important things to work on and showcase to get a tech job in my opinion.

## Personal Portfolio and Resume

This is your first impression with the company. Having a clean resume with an attached github portfolio is a bare minimum for software development.

### Resume

Only put technical experience (internships or research) on your resume. Having other work experience is good but will not serve much good on a resume that is being scanned by AI for certain buzz words.

Instead, use the job posting to harvest the keywords and then if you need extra things, highlight course work, especially project based classes.

Each section should have the name, place and time. Then have a brief description highlighting what, then 2-3 bullet points highlighting metrics and deliverables.
(For a class that could be the major projects you did in it)

## Technical Skills

This is where you feel the most out of depth, but focus on what you know and how you best learn new things. A company hires junior engineers for HOW they can learn, not what they already know.

But the biggest things I would focus on here in technical skills is Data Structures (knowing the basics here, nothing crazy), Design Patterns, and Leet Code.

## Networking

Networking and soft skills, not technical skills will get you your first job. A better engineer that cant interview well will get passed over for the confident and good interviewer but slightly worse engineering skills.
Reach out to all of your sources you know, college advisors, family, friends, etc. It is about anything to get in the door. And if you are not getting traction, messaging recruiters on LinkedIn with something like "I want to get to know the role" is also good (this one is going to be harder because a lot of people are doing this now, but still better than a cold apply)

## Talking the Talk

Software just like other technical professions has such a deep well of knowledge so its impossible to know everything, but being able to engage in converations about code will help you a lot.

For this I would recommend finding your interest and watching videos on their architecture. There are really great youtube resources here or we can even talk about it.

# Conclusion

If any of this is not clicking, let me know but at the end of the day, skill inflation is really bad in software engineering, they say they want 5 years experience for entry level and their job posting sounds hard, but it is all optics. Find your connections and apply
